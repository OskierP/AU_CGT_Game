Game in development by students from Aarhus University in Denmark

Martian mission is an epic single player, story driven game, testing the wit and craftiness of X in a dangerous region of space. When players first start the game there will be an intro scene showing X and Cosmo battling aliens, who come from Venus, and getting separated. After this scene, the player will appear in a dark room inside the Alien captors base surrounded by enemies. Once the player spawns in the game, there will be instructions explaining the controls and X’s abilities.

Sometimes there may be an overwhelming number of aliens all around the player. In this case, enemies will appear packed tightly, so they are easy to group together. This helps players simplify any stimuli that are overwhelming in number. Our game will have some slower levels with puzzles that help keep your mind engaged, requiring a decent level of logic and spatial awareness to solve. Some levels will be fast requiring you to rely more on your reaction time and aim. 

There is loot in the game and objects that can temporarily upgrade X’s abilities. These items will be very distinct from the background so players will know to pick them up. There is a space map showing players how close they are to their final destination, seen on page 4. 
Players should become more hopeful throughout the game as they look at the map and see they are getting closer and closer to Cosmo on Mars. There will be a few cutscenes between completing levels to help tell the story and keep players engaged. At the end of the game, there will be colourful theatrics symbolizing victory to make the player feel more rewarded for beating the game.
